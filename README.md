# Your universe
It's my fifth app :)

### Description:
This application demonstrates my ability to work with URLSession and Alamofire.
It makes a request to the NASA website and receives from there the photo of the day, its name, description and copyright (copyright is optional) and beautifully displays it all on the screen.
According to NASA's description, the photo will be different every day.

### The task was:
Using the Alamofire framework, make a request to the NASA website with an open API, get a photo, title and description from there, display them on the screen and customize the interface. Follow MVC architecture.
